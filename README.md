## Introduction

Welcome to the Photo Album Showcase! This Next.js application, written in TypeScript, is designed to provide a beautiful and user-friendly way to showcase photo albums. It leverages the power of Next.js, Next.js App Router for server side render, Material UI, React.js, the Typecode Placeholder API, and Cypress for e2e testing. 

The project is open source and licensed under the MIT License.
